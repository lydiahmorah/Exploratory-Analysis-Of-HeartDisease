# Heart Disease Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

- Welcome to my Heart Disease Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! 

  This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a heart disease dataset, aimed at uncovering valuable insights and patterns that can help in understanding the factors contributing to heart disease.

  The project utilizes various data analysis techniques and visualization tools to explore the dataset and derive meaningful conclusions.

# Objective

- The primary objective of this project is to perform a thorough exploratory data analysis on a heart disease dataset to:

 1. Understand the structure and distribution of the data.

 2. Identify any missing or duplicate values and handle them appropriately.

  3. Explore relationships between different variables and their impact on heart disease.

 4. Visualize the distribution of heart disease across various demographic and health-related attributes.

 5. Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis.

# Dataset

- The dataset used in this project is a well-known heart disease dataset that includes various attributes such as age, gender, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, and more. 

- The target variable indicates the presence or absence of heart disease.

# Steps Taken

1. Data Importation: Loaded the dataset and necessary Python libraries.

2. Initial Data Inspection: Displayed the top rows and checked the dataset's shape to understand its structure.

3. **Data Information**: Retrieved information about data types, memory usage, and null values.

4. **Data Cleaning**: Identified and removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity.

5. **Statistical Summary**: Generated descriptive statistics to summarize the dataset's central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the data's distribution.

6. **Correlation Analysis**: Created a correlation matrix to examine relationships between variables.

7. **Target Variable Distribution**: Analyzed and visualized the distribution of heart disease presence in the dataset.

8. **Demographic Analysis**: Explored the distribution of gender and its relation to heart disease.

9. **Visualizations**: Utilized various plots to visually represent the findings, making it easier to interpret and communicate results.

# Findings and Recommendations

- Based on the analysis, several key insights were uncovered, such as the higher prevalence of heart disease among males and significant correlations between certain health metrics and heart disease.

- These findings led to actionable recommendations for targeted health interventions, further research on correlated variables, and the development of predictive models.

# Conclusion

- This project demonstrates the power of exploratory data analysis in uncovering hidden patterns and insights in healthcare data.

  By understanding the factors that contribute to heart disease, we can better inform healthcare strategies and improve patient outcomes.
